__Notes__:

## Problem 1

Variables that will be needed:
-Something to store for the sizes of nugget containers, 6, 9, 20. Data dictionary strucutre for small, medium, large would work. 
-Variable to store the most recent largest that we cannot get. 
-Candidate number that stores current number we are at.
-Variable that stores the count

Functions needed:
-Define $\mbox(Nugget Number) = a * 6 + b * 9 + c * 20$
-We need a Boolean function called 'is_nugget_number'

Stopping rule:
-When you get six candidates in a row as nugget numbers



## Problem 2
Variables needed:
-random number integer for computer to guess between 1 and 100
-


Functions needed:
-a function for the computer to guess a number
